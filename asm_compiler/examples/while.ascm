; this code currently doesn't work at all I just needed to visualize the logic

lit "1" "1"

; while

# "while_start" ; we need one sp for the condition check

; check condition
brc #"while_body"
jmp #"while_end"

# "while_body" ; and one for the body

jmp #"while_start"

# "while_end" ; this would be the pop sp
