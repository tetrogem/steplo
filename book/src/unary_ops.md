# Unary Operaters

Unary operators can create expressions that take one other expression as input. An example of a binary operator is the not `!` operator:

```
main || {
    out(!true); // prints false
}
```

All the currently existing unary operators and the types they evaluate to:
| Operator | Operand Type | = Evaluated Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ! (not) | bool | bool |
